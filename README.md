<h1>Birthday Email Sender</h1>

The Birthday Email Sender is a Python script that sends personalized birthday emails to people in your CSV list of birthdays. It selects a random letter template, replaces placeholders with the person's name, and sends the email using the smtplib library.

The project was done as part of the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) - Day 32.
